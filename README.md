The application was designed to show how to work with dates in JS. 
I tend to believe that I managed to develop quite a good algorithm for deadlines calculation which takes into account days-off and non-working hours. I used modern technologies such as: React with hooks and moment.js. The components were tested via jest and enzyme. Also, the application logic was tested with help of test.each`table` tabular form.
